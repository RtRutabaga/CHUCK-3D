/**
 * A human NPC on the docks (user 2026-09-30: start with the dock worker by the
 * spawn; more NPCs will follow - the 2D game's guard and market woman).
 * A MakeHuman body dressed by Tools/build_npc_humans.py on the humans' shared
 * 31-bone skeleton (MPFB cmu_mb), procedurally posed from its A-pose (a
 * relaxed standing pose solved per body: no arms held out):
 * breathing, a slow weight shift, idle glances, and his head turning to watch
 * Chuck when the rat comes near. Solid to Chuck but not climbable (a
 * pawn-only blocker: wall-run, ledge and camera traces ignore him).
 *
 * Talk: an NPC with Lines shows a prompt in range and Chuck talks to him
 * with F / Y (AChuckCharacter::Interact); lines advance on each press. One
 * with no lines is ambient (the worker, for now: no dialogue yet, user's call).
 * NPC speech only - Chuck never speaks (AGENTS.md).
