# Agent handoff — Claude Code

Per-session log, newest first. Template: [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). Prototype-era entries (character, rig, traversal, camera, sewer, NPCs) are in [../archive/agent-handoffs/CLAUDE-PROTOTYPE.md](../archive/agent-handoffs/CLAUDE-PROTOTYPE.md).

## October 12 — the fall-to-Chult cutscene

- **Owner, task, branch:** Claude, the Phase 3 fall-to-Chult cutscene on the user's "Fall Cutscene theme", on `main` at `C:\GameDev\CHUCK-3D`. Base `c589b8f`.
- **What it is:** falling through the cellar's sky hole now plays an authored 47.5 s cutscene instead of the instant "End of demo" card. It follows the 2D `falling_cutscene_scene.py` beats:
  1. The cellar view watches him drop away, and a white fade opens on open sky.
  2. A wide shot of a small rat over a sea of volumetric cloud under a teal sky.
  3. His face, from below.
  4. Looking down past him at the deck, with mist rushing up through it.
  5. Out under the deck over the jungle.
  6. Up from the canopy as he comes out of the clouds.
  7. The crash through three branches, timed to the score's breakdown, and the impact.
  8. His quiet astral death and summon on the jungle floor, during the rebuild.
  9. He looks off to his left and back.
  10. A close-up drag, with two exhales.
  11. A low pull-back to a small rat at the foot of buttressed giants, with the music fading over the last two bars of the second section (43.76–47.52 s) and the picture going black.
  12. The end card.
  - Letterboxed to about 2.2:1, no HUD and no control; Esc skips to the card, where Esc exits.
- **Music analysis:** stdlib Python found about 128 bpm and the section boundaries. The details are in `SourceAssets/Audio/README.md`, and the shot cuts sit on the bar lines (`FallCutscene.h`). The WAV is unedited; the fade is at runtime.
- **Changed paths:**
  - **New:** `Source/Chuck3D/FallCutscene.h/.cpp`; `Tools/build_fall_jungle.py`, `gen_fall_sfx.py` and `import_fall_cutscene.py`; `SourceAssets/Cutscenes/FallToChult/*`; `SourceAssets/Audio/FallToChult.wav` and `SFX/SFX_FallWind_00`, `SFX_LeafCrash_00..02` with `fall-manifest.json`; `/Game/Art/Cutscenes/FallToChult/*`, `/Game/Art/Audio/SW_FallToChult` and the four SFX assets.
  - **Edited:**
    - `ChuckCharacter.h/.cpp`: the sky-hole trigger starts the cutscene; added cutscene mode, `EndFallCutscene` and the pose puppet.
    - `DockGameMode.h/.cpp`: `FadeOutMusic`, a music-region guard and the HUD letterbox.
    - `DockPantry.cpp`: `-ChuckDemoEndTest` now expects the cutscene and Esc skip; new `-ChuckFallCutsceneTest`.
    - Docs.
  - **Outside my usual ownership:** `Tools/Verify-Package.ps1` (Codex's verification tooling) now also requires `CHUCK_DEMO_SKIP_TEST` and runs the full cutscene test.
- **Contracts:** no rig, socket or slot change. Chuck is puppeted through his existing clips: JumpLoop, Summon, Idle, TurnLeft90/TurnRight90 with the `ChuckClipData::TurnYaw` profile, `Exhale()` and `SetAstralHidden`. `AFallCutscene` is a `friend` of `AChuckCharacter`. Sanity and cigarettes are untouched. Hand-off to Chult: replace the `EndFallCutscene()` call in `AFallCutscene::Finish()` (see regions/CHULT.md).
- **Stage:** 25 km from the docks, at (4 km, 25 km, 0), placed under the world-anchored cloud deck. At the white cut every dock actor is hidden, its lights, fog, post-process and sounds switched off, and the stage is built:
  - Sky atmosphere with teal Rayleigh scattering.
  - A volumetric cloud deck at 2.0–3.1 km (`MI_FallClouds`, coverage 0.22, density 0.035).
  - A sun with cloud shadows, a real-time sky light, height fog with volumetric fog and auto exposure.
  - About 13,600 instances: 11,900 canopy crowns, 1,240 trunks, the clearing's trees and understory, and 150 mist puffs.
  - A 4,000 km far canopy plane.
- **Commands actually run:**
  - `blender --background --python Tools/build_fall_jungle.py`.
  - `python -I Tools/gen_fall_sfx.py`.
  - `UnrealEditor-Cmd ... -ExecutePythonScript=Tools/import_fall_cutscene.py -AllowCommandletAudio`, which logs `Local/fall-cutscene-import.log`.
  - `Build.bat Chuck3DEditor`.
  - About 14 uncooked `-game -ChuckFallCutsceneTest` capture runs, iterating on the look from contact sheets.
  - One `-ChuckDemoEndTest` run.
  - `Build-Game.ps1 -Package -ArchiveDirectory Builds/FallCutsceneCandidate`.
- **Gotcha found:** the editor target's `Intermediate/Build/Win64/x64/Chuck3DEditor/Development/Makefile.bin` dated from 2026-10-09 and pointed at the old OneDrive copy. My first two editor builds "succeeded" but compiled and linked `C:\Users\ashsm\OneDrive\Documents\GameDev\CHUCK-3D` instead; only its generated Binaries and Intermediate changed, and no sources were touched. Deleting the stale makefile fixed it. After a build, check the DLL timestamp.
- **Tests (uncooked, final):**
  - `CHUCK_FALL_CUTSCENE_END at=47.53 skipped=0 landed=1 vanished=1 summoned=1 exhales=2` and `CHUCK_FALL_CUTSCENE_TEST failures=0 card=1`.
  - The music plays at 10 s.
  - Frame rate at 1280×720 on the RTX 4060: about 58 fps average in sky, canopy and floor. Worst frames were 128, 99 and 109 ms; the largest hitch is the stage build under the white.
  - `-ChuckDemoEndTest`: `CHUCK_DEMO_END_TEST failures=0 sky_ends=1 ...`, `CHUCK_DEMO_SKIP_TEST failures=0 card=1` and `CHUCK_DEMO_EXIT escape=1`.
  - Evidence: `Local/fall-cutscene-test.log`, `Local/demo-end-test.log`, and captures in `Unreal/Chuck3D/Saved/Screenshots/WindowsEditor/FallCutscene/`.
- **Package:** `Build-Game.ps1 -Package -ArchiveDirectory Builds/FallCutsceneCandidate` succeeded (`Local/fall-cutscene-build.log`). `Verify-Package` gave **182 passes**, with the new checks passing: `Local/verify-demo-end-20261012-203529.log` (`CHUCK_DEMO_SKIP_TEST failures=0 card=1`) and `Local/verify-fall-cutscene-20261012-203545.log` (`CHUCK_FALL_CUTSCENE_TEST failures=0 card=1`; about 58/57/58 fps cooked). The cooked captures in `Builds/FallCutsceneCandidate/Windows/Chuck3D/Saved/Screenshots/Windows/FallCutscene/` match the editor captures, clouds and foliage included.
- **Known flaws:**
  - The jungle set is procedural cards and primitives: bright, flat green leaves; repetitive pole-like distant trunks; no visible volumetric light shafts.
  - The far canopy reads flat from altitude.
  - In the shot right under the deck (about 17.5–19 s) the jungle is mostly lost in haze.
  - The exhale is the game's puff effect, a soft white ball in close-up.
  - The fall pose is the JumpLoop clip with body rotation, not a dedicated skydive or tumble clip; there is no jacket flap.
  - Leaf vertex blue (dryness) arrives wrong after FBX import, so it is ignored.
  - The art target images have not been reached.
  - Not tested: physical Xbox play, listening on speakers, full-screen or other resolutions.
- **Binaries:** about 28 MB new, all under the LFS rules (`.wav`, `.png`, `.fbx`, `.uasset`). The 14 `Common/Materials` re-saves from `create_base_assets.py` during the build were restored rather than committed.
- **Heavy tools running:** none at hand-off.

Next part of the work can only be done by Codex: the Chult landing setting (milestone 1), after the user approves regions/CHULT.md. Claude then connects the cutscene to it.

## October 12 — full-game cleanup (steps 1–4)

- **Commits:**
  - `3fb1a1b`: full-game brief and AGENTS scope.
  - `e06c6bc`: the 38 regenerated assets.
  - `4ada88c`: Codex's Chult plan, committed on its behalf.
  - Then the rename, the docs archive and this handoff.
- **Contracts:** no rig, socket or material-slot change. Material asset paths changed from `/Game/Prototype/Materials/M_*` to `/Game/Common/Materials/M_*`, and the map is now `/Game/Maps/WaterdeepDocks`. Any new script or code must use the new paths.
- **Commands run:**
  - `UnrealEditor-Cmd -run=pythonscript Local/migrate_prototype_content.py`. The materials moved; the map rename was cancelled by a dialog in unattended mode.
  - `Build-Game.ps1 -Package -ArchiveDirectory Builds/RenameCandidate`, which runs `Verify-Package` (182/0).
  - `Verify-Menu` (7/7).
  - `Promote-Build.ps1 -Label Rename`. The first attempt failed safely because my shell's working directory was inside the candidate; the previous build was restored automatically.
- **Lesson:** don't leave a shell inside `Builds/<Candidate>` before promoting.
- **2D game access:** read with absolute paths only; one relative `mkdir` was blocked by the deny rule and nothing was written there.

Next part of the work could be done by either — preference: the user reviews regions/CHULT.md first, then Claude does the fall to Chult.
